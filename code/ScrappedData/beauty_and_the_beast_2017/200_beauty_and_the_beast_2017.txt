Think twice about beauty and the beast Although this movie hand a happy ending, my 8 y.o daughter had to sit through 2 hours of traumatizing violence to get there. Beauty and the beast added several very fightening wolf pack attacks on Bells father, Bell, the horse and the beast. Other terrifying scenes included Bells father getting beaten by gaston who left him tied to a tree for the wolves to eat, mother dying of the plague, Gaston turning the crowd against Bells father and locking him in the paddy wagon and the final finale between Gaston and the beast were just too much. My daughter left the theater crying and took an hour of comforting to stop. She couldn't sleep in her own bed that night and never wants to go to the movies again. Thanks Disney for terrorizing my daughter- you out did yourself this time. Parents think twice before lining up. My advice is watch it first to determine if your child can handle this movie.
