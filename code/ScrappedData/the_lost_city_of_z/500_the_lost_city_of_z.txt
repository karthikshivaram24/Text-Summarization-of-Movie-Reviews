His first expedition was in 1906, when swathes of South America were still white spaces on Royal Geographical Society charts. But director James Gray seems to come from a slightly later era. This classy film – and I mean film (it was shot on celluloid) – feels like it comes from the middle of the last century. When Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) heads into the darkest depths of the Amazon jungle, he finds himself dodging flying spears, batting off man-eating piranhas, and making uneasy alliances with ­cannibals. But Gray spends as much time exploring the man and his age as he does staging thrilling action scenes. His Fawcett is more Lawrence of Arabia than Indiana Jones. Fawcett gets hooked on adventure as a major in the British Army who is tasked with settling a border dispute between Brazil and Bolivia which is hitting the rubber trade. At first this is just an opportunity for the ambitious soldier to gain acceptance into the officer class. “He has been rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors,” sniffs one bewhiskered old cove. To get his shot at glory, Fawcett agrees to head a small-scale mapping expedition. After bidding farewell to his feisty wife Nina (Sienna Miller) he joins up with Army comrade Henry Costin (a bearded Robert Pattinson) and a band of underlings for a two-year adventure. This is the first of three expeditions in the film. After a few brushes with death, Fawcett stumbles on artefacts which seem to back up local tales of an ancient city lost to the “green desert” of the jungle.
