The Boss Baby: just a corny kidflick – or a subtle political satire? Read more Glengarry Glen Ross, 30 Rock, SNL’s President Trump … Alec Baldwin gives a quickfire recapitulation of those classic earlier turns in this amusing if convoluted animation, which, like the recent baby comedy Storks, ties itself in knots developing the initial premise. There’s some good-natured entertainment along the way, and Baldwin’s husky basso profundo is always enjoyable. He is the voice of Boss Baby, a suit-wearing, briefcase-carrying newborn who is resented by his seven-year-old brother Tim (voiced by Miles Christopher Bakshi) for tyrannically imposing his corporate-style rule on the household. The Trumpian tininess of his hands is periodically shown up when he attempts a handshake or a fistbump. There is an elaborate backstory showing babies chugging along in a celestial prebirth production line, destined for “family” or “management” roles according to whether they are ticklish. It doesn’t exactly make sense: what do America’s families think of all these other thousands of management babies? Whatever, Boss Baby and Tim wind up making common cause against a sinister conspiracy to promote eternally young puppies over babies. It’s disposable fun.
