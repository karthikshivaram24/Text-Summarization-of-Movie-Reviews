THE BOSS BABY Direction: Tom McGrath Actors: Alec Baldwin, Miles Bakshi Rating: 2.5 / 5 It’s all about sibling rivalry. This over-plotted 3D animation romp kicks off with a seven-year- old boy (dubbed in dulcet tones by Miles Bakshi) whose pampered existence unravels with the arrival of a new baby in the family. Adapted from the 2010 picture book by Marla Frazee, the script relies a little too heavily on pop-culture references and juvenile jokes. In the event, The Boss Baby doesn’t quite deliver on its initial promise of madcap comedy. To begin with, little brother turns out to be a suit-wearing, briefcase-carrying toddler (expressively voiced by Alec Baldwin) with an agenda of his own. Alec Baldwin is expressive as the voice of the suit-wearing infant. Initially upset about losing his only-child status, the protagonist puts his sibling rivalry on hold in order to save his parents (Lisa Kudrow-Jimmy Kimmel) from the machinations of a corporate honcho (an appropriately haughty Steve Buscemi). Expectedly, the kiddie duo make good on their mission, even ensuring that there is an infinite amount of love to go around in the world. The film’s locales, including a stopover in Las Vegas during an Elvis Presley impersonation convention, are evocatively rendered. The production design is distinctive. The production design, too, is distinctive, especially the assembly line delivery system for babies. Gratifyingly, more than 100 technicians of Indian origin have contributed to various aspects of the production. The Boss Baby should make for a pretty good family outing on a scorching afternoon.
