The film opens with a disembodied shot of fires and drums in a jungle clearing – the secret’s already waiting for Fawcett, before he even knows he wants to find it – then moves to a British army barracks in Cork, Ireland, 1905, where he and his fellow officers are deer coursing. The hunt sequence is a dream of pageantry – the camera scampering with the gun dogs one moment then soaring overhead the next, all to stirring bagpipe music. (The soundtrack includes a radiant, yearning score by Christopher Spelman and perfectly chosen works by Stravinsky, Ravel, Strauss, Verdi and Beethoven.) Fawcett gets the kill, but he’s kept at arm’s length from the celebrations by his class. As one of his social betters piteously sniffs, he has been “rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors”: in other words, his father was a gambler and a drunk. So when Ian McDiarmid’s Royal Geographical Society grandee asks Fawcett to travel to South America and resolve a land dispute between Bolivia and Brazil, he suggests the two-year quest could be a means of reclaiming his family name. Fawcett accepts, even though it means leaving behind his beloved wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and son Jack (played as a child by Tom Mulheron and Bobby Smalldridge, and later as a teenager by Tom Holland). Eternity comes before the here and now.
