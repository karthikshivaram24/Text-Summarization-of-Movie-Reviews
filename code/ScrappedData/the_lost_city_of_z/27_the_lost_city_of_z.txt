Parents need to know that The Lost City of Z is a a fact-based historical adventure/drama about the search for a lost Amazonian city. Originally rated R but edited to get a PG-13, the movie has sporadic but strong violence, including guns and shooting, bloody wounds, hunting sequences (with animals killed), arrows piercing a man's chest, fighting, and other iffy images. Topless women native to the Amazon are shown, and there's brief mild innuendo. Language includes "goddamn" and "bastard." Characters occasionally drink from flasks and smoke, and one character's father is described as a drinker and a gambler who ruined the family name. Even though it might come across as an exciting jungle adventure, the movie is slow, dense, and mature, and it's unlikely to excite many teens. Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson co-star; the movie is based on the book by David Grann.
