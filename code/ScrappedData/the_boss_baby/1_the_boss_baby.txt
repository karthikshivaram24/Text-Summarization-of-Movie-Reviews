In the politically polarized world in which we live, one thing seems certain: People aren't going to give up their desire for escapism. That observation becomes clear when you look at what moviegoers are watching. For the second week in a row, the DreamWorks Animation film "The Boss Baby" led the nation's box-office earnings list. And if that weren't enough, the Disney live-action version of "Beauty and the Beast" is nearing a cool $1 billion in world-wide earnings. "The Boss Baby" has a political edge, too. Though the story is told from the perspective of an older sibling who resents the intrusion of his new baby brother, and is largely imaginary, it features Alec Baldwin as the voice of the title character. And considering the Twitter battle that Baldwin has been having with Donald Trump, exacerbated by the president's ongoing Tweets and Baldwin's impersonation of him on "Saturday Night Live," the movie's high ratings — far higher than the president's — feel a bit ironic. The movie even feature a couple of lines to the effect of "You're fired!" — the reference being obvious. Mostly, though, "The Boss Baby" is a funny, clever take on sibling rivalry that should appeal both to children — especially those who, we can be thankful, are removed from politics — and their parents.
