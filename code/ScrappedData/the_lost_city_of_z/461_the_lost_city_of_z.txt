“The Lost City of Z” is beautiful. Good lord, is it beautiful. The story of real-life British explorer Percy Fawcett, it follows a tireless quest to find a mythical ancient city in the Amazon. “Z” can rightfully be called a sweeping, old-fashioned epic, by which I mean there are many sequences of Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) and his team struggling manfully through the jungle, menaced by disease and weather and wild animals and hostile natives. It’s a mission fueled by a near-maniacal obsession, with undertones of “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Apocalypse Now” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Fitzcarraldo” (though I am not suggesting it measures up to any of those; it doesn’t). I’m a longtime lover of epics: Just hearing a few notes from the “Lawrence” or “Raiders” soundtracks can make me tear up. What fun to lose yourself in a grand cinematic quest for something magnificent: “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp,” as Fawcett’s wife (Sienna Miller) puts it. Yeah: A white man’s reach, specifically. If you’re a woman or a nonwhite character, look forward to sitting patiently on the sidelines or serving as a useful but ultimately disposable prop to help the hero do something important. This is the sad truth about nearly all epic adventure movies, and “Z” is no different. “I shall give you an Indian!” Fawcett says helpfully to one of his departing fellow explorers. (Way to make friends with the locals, buddy.) “I know this is a sacrifice for all of us,” he tells his wife as he trots off on a multiyear jungle excursion, leaving her to raise their young children alone. So noble! By all means, go see “The Lost City of Z” — I wouldn’t have missed it. But spare a thought for all the less celebrated characters in it — in any classical epic, really — who make a white guy’s grand romantic adventure possible.
