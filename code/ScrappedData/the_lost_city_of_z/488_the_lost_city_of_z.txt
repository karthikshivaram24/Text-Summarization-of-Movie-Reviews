The Lost City of Z Release Date: April 14 Director: James Gray Stars: Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller, Tom Holland The latest epic period drama from director Gray (The Immigrant) vibrates with the aftershocks of Herzog, Apocalypse Now, and even 2015’s Embrace of the Serpent, and while it never quite escapes those intimidating shadows, it’s an engaging picture nonetheless – and a gorgeous one, its overwhelming images (lensed by the great Darius Khondji) blessed with the grace of a ballet and the period resonance of tintype photos. Charlie Hunnam comes up short in the lead – his general stiffness works early on, but leaves the picture wanting in the clutch – but Robert Pattinson is terrific as his right-hand man, and Sienna Miller does well with rather an empty supportive wife role. The elegant cutting and handsome staging match the pretty pictures, and if the film never quite finds comparable emotional intensity, well, as one character puts it, “to look for what is beautiful is its own reward.”
