Photo The animated feature “The Boss Baby” has some hilarious moments. If, that is, you’re a grown-up. It’s a movie whose story is aimed at the siblings of newborns — the 8-and-under crowd, more or less. They’ll follow the plot for most of the way; they just might be puzzled by their accompanying parent’s reactions. “What’s so funny, Dad?” Video That’s because the title character is voiced by Alec Baldwin, and all of his various past personas, especially the one from “30 Rock,” somehow make hearing his distinctive voice coming from a cartoon infant all that much funnier. The story, based on a picture book by Marla Frazee, is told from the viewpoint of Tim (Miles Bakshi or, when he’s in narrator mode, Tobey Maguire), a 7-year-old only child who is not happy when his parents (Lisa Kudrow and Jimmy Kimmel) tell him a brother is on the way. Tim has a vivid imagination, and in his eyes the baby arrives wearing a business suit, bosses his parents around and has dubious intentions. The contrast between the helpless-infant stage of life and corporate-speak is funny but fairly high-concept for a kiddie movie, and the plot grows denser as it goes along and the baby and Tim reluctantly join forces to stop a conspiracy by which puppies would corner all the love in the world. The film, directed by Tom McGrath (“Megamind,” the “Madagascar” movies), is also full of homages and such that no young child is going to get. Psst: Hey grown-ups, no need to tell the kids that; just let them squirm while you enjoy the adult flourishes.
